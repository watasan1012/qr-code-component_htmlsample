## Where to find everything

どこにでもあるもの


Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 

課題は、`/design`フォルダの中にあるデザインをもとにプロジェクトを組み立てることです。モバイル版とデスクトップ版の両方のデザインがあります。


The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.

デザインはJPGの静止画形式です。JPGを使用する場合、`font-size`、`padding`、`margin`などのスタイルについては、あなたの最善の判断を下す必要があります。


If you would like the design files (we provide Sketch & Figma versions) to inspect the design in more detail, you can [subscribe as a PRO member](https://www.frontendmentor.io/pro).

より詳細なデザインを確認するためにデザインファイル（Sketch & Figma版を提供）をご希望の方は、[PRO会員](https://www.frontendmentor.io/pro)にご登録ください。


You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

必要なアセットは `/images` フォルダにあります。アセットはすでに最適化されています。


There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

また、カラーパレットやフォントなど、必要な情報を含む `style-guide.md` ファイルも用意されています。


## Building your project

プロジェクトの構築


Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:

どのようなワークフローでも、ご自由にお使いください。以下は推奨されるプロセスですが、これらのステップに従わなければならないと感じることはありません。


1. Initialize your project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/). 

プロジェクトをgithubの公開リポジトリとして初期化する.


Creating a repo will make it easier to share your code with the community if you need help. 

レポジトリを作成することで、助けが必要なときにコミュニティとコードを共有しやすくなります。


If you're not sure how to do this, [have a read-through of this Try Git resource](https://try.github.io/).

この方法がよくわからない場合は、この[Try Gitリソース](https://try.github.io/)を一読してください。


2. Configure your repository to publish your code to a web address. This will also be useful if you need some help during a challenge as you can share the URL for your project with your repo URL. There are a number of ways to do this, and we provide some recommendations below.

コードをウェブアドレスに公開するように、リポジトリを設定します。

これは、プロジェクトの URL をリポジトリの URL で共有できるため、挑戦中に何らかの助けが必要な場合にも役立ちます。

これを行うにはいくつかの方法がありますが、以下にいくつかの推奨事項を示します。


3. Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.

デザインに目を通し、プロジェクトにどのように取り組むか計画を立て始める。このステップは、再利用可能なスタイルを作成するために、CSSクラスについて前もって考えるのに非常に重要です。


4. Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.

スタイルを追加する前に、HTMLでコンテンツを構成してください。HTMLを先に記述することで、構造化されたコンテンツを作成することに集中することができます。


5. Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.

`font-family`や`font-size`などの一般的なコンテンツスタイルを含む、プロジェクトの基本スタイルを書き出します。


6. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.

ページの一番上にスタイルを追加し、下に向かう。作業中のエリアが完了したら、次のセクションに進みます。


## Deploying your project

プロジェクトの公開

As mentioned above, there are many ways to host your project for free. Our recommend hosts are:

上記のように、あなたのプロジェクトを無料でホストする方法はたくさんあります。私たちのお勧めのホストは、以下の通りです。


- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

You can host your site using one of these solutions or any of our other trusted providers. 

れらのソリューション、または私たちの他の信頼できるプロバイダーのいずれかを使用して、サイトをホストすることができます。[私たちの推奨と信頼できるホストについての詳細を読む] 。


[Read more about our recommended and trusted hosts](https://medium.com/frontend-mentor/frontend-mentor-trusted-hosting-providers-bf000dfebe).


## Create a custom `README.md`

カスタムREADME.mdを作成する

We strongly recommend overwriting this `README.md` with a custom one.

この `README.md` を独自のもので上書きすることを強くお勧めします。


We've provided a template inside the [`README-template.md`](./README-template.md) file in this starter code.

このスターターコードの [`README-template.md`](./README-template.md) ファイル内にテンプレートを用意しました。


The template provides a guide for what to add. A custom `README` will help you explain your project and reflect on your learnings. Please feel free to edit our template as much as you like.

テンプレートは、何を追加すべきかのガイドを提供します。カスタム `README` は、あなたのプロジェクトを説明し、学びを振り返るのに役立ちます。このテンプレートは自由に編集してください。


Once you've added your information to the template, delete this file and rename the `README-template.md` file to `README.md`. That will make it show up as your repository's README file.

テンプレートに情報を追加したら、このファイルを削除し、 `README-template.md` ファイルを `README.md` にリネームしてください。これで、リポジトリの README ファイルとして表示されるようになります。

A complete guide to submitting solutions on Frontend Mentor
So, you’ve put in the time to build out your solution. You’re happy with how it looks and have tried matching it up to the design. Now it’s time to submit it to the platform!

You’ll find all of the challenges you’re currently working on on the My Challenges page, which you can get to by clicking “Submit a solution” or “My challenges” on the Home page. Once you’re on the My Challenges page, click the one you’d like to submit a solution for from the “In Progress” section. This will take you to the challenge hub where you can click “Submit Solution” and fill in the submission form.

Here is a walkthrough of the various fields you’ll need to fill in:

1) Title
This step is pretty simple. Try to make sure that your title is nice and descriptive so that it helps catch people’s attention. For example, instead of just adding a title of “HTML and CSS solution” you could say “Mobile-first solution using CSS Grid and Flexbox”. This helps add context to your solution and can lead to more people looking at it.

2) Repository URL
The word “repository” relates to Git version control. We need to create a repository where your code is stored so that other people can easily see it.

Let’s first create an empty repository on GitHub, then you can choose which approach you’d like to take:

Go to your GitHub profile and click the + icon at the top and select “New repository”
Be sure to give your repository a meaningful name and ensure its visibility is set to “Public”. Click “Create repository”.
You’ve now created an empty repository on GitHub. So the next thing you need to do is to connect your local project with the remote repository and push your code to GitHub.
There are two options here depending on whether or not you have learned basic Git commands yet.

Option 1 — No knowledge of Git
Once you’ve created your empty repository, it will navigate to a page with basic setup instructions. Near the top of the page, it should say “Get started by creating a new file or uploading an existing file.” Click on “uploading an existing file”.
You’ll be taken to a page where you can now drag and drop your files which will upload them to GitHub. Be sure to upload only the files inside of your project folder and not the project folder itself. Add a commit message, like “Initial commit” and select “Commit changes”.
You’ll now see your files have been uploaded to GitHub. To make updates, you can use the “Upload Files” option that you’ll see on the page and upload files again once you’ve made changes.
Option 2 — At least a basic knowledge of Git
If you haven’t installed Git on your computer, you can install it here. Also, if you haven’t learned Git yet, you might want to read through the book online. However, this guide will give you everything you need to submit your solution without knowing Git inside out.

You can create a repository on any Git platform, such as GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket. We use GitHub for authentication on Frontend Mentor, so we’ll carry on with GitHub as an example for the rest of this guide.

GitHub also has an incredible learning lab resource if you’d like to learn more about the platform.

OK, let’s take your code from your local machine and push it up to GitHub. Note that if you have any GitHub authentication issues while working through these steps, you might want to try connecting to GitHub with SSH for authentication.

Here are the steps you’ll need to follow to push your code to GitHub:

Open the terminal and navigate to the root level (first level) of your project folder. Your command will look something like this cd /path/to/my/project-folder. Once there, type git init to initialize Git version control in your project.
Next, add all of your files, so that they’re “staged” and ready to be committed. You can do this by typing git add . on the command line.
Commit your files with a message by typing git commit -m "Initial commit"
Now we need to make the connection between your locally initialized project and the remote Git repository on GitHub. To do this, copy the command from the repository setup page that looks like this:git remote add origin git@github.com:username/repository-name.git. Paste it into the command line and hit enter.
Next, push the code to that repository by typing git push -u origin master and hitting enter.
Your code should now be pushed to the remote repository on GitHub. You can double-check this by refreshing the repository page. The setup instructions should disappear and be replaced by your code.
Now that you’ve pushed your code to GitHub using either the manual upload or the Git terminal commands, copy the URL and past it into the Repository URL field on the solution submission form.

3) Live Site URL
The Live Site URL is where you need to provide a link to a working version of your project. This is what people are going to see when they preview your solution and give you feedback, so it’s crucial that this link is working.

There are a number of ways to create a live version of your project using the code from your code repository. Here are a few options we recommend:

GitHub Pages
This is arguably the easiest way to create a live URL for your project. Go to Settings on your repository, scroll down to the GitHub Pages section and configure it to track your main/master branch.

As soon as it’s all hooked up, you’ll be able to see your project using the URL GitHub provides!

Vercel
Vercel is doing incredible things in the front-end ecosystem. They’re a top-class tool that we’d recommend getting to know and playing around with.

They make it easy to connect your repo (GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket) and publish to a live URL.

For more information on getting set up, head over to the Vercel documentation.

Netlify
Netlify is another incredible tool that is worth getting to know as a front-end developer. It’s effortless to connect your repo and publish it to a live URL which will track any changes you make to your code.

To get set up with Netlify, check out the Netlify docs.

If you’d prefer not to use one of these options you can read more about our trusted providers. You’ll need to use one of these options in order to post your solution on Frontend Mentor.

Once you’ve got your live URL, visit it to make sure the project looks as expected. If it doesn’t and you’re not sure how to resolve the issue, you can post a question in the #help channel of the Frontend Mentor Slack community. There are plenty of people there who will be happy to help you troubleshoot your issue.

If you’re happy with how your project looks you can simply paste the URL in the Live Site URL field.

4) Tags
You can add tags to your solution to add more context to it. Adding tags helps others on the platform discover your solution if they’re following a tag you use. Tags are for additional tools, techniques, and topics you focused on with your project. You won’t see HTML, CSS, and JavaScript tags, as they’re implied by the languages required for a challenge. But you will see tags like “react”, “bem”, and “accessibility”. Be sure to add the tags you feel are relevant to your project. If you haven’t used any additional tools, it’s fine to leave the tags empty.

5) Questions for the community
Although this field is optional, it’s absolutely crucial to write something if you’re looking to get feedback on your solution. Solutions with questions show up on the dashboard and so are much easier to find than solutions without questions.

Be as specific as you can be when you write your questions. The more specific you can be the more specific and focused the feedback will be. Writing something like “Please provide feedback” or “Please tell me how I can improve” isn’t likely to help you get valuable and detailed feedback.

So be sure to put some thought and effort into your questions. The more you can help the people out who are looking to give you feedback the more likely you will be to get receive valuable insights.

6) Submit Solution
Now it’s time to submit your solution! Once you’ve submitted your solution, don’t forget to check the design comparison and the solution report. These will give you valuable insights into any visual or code-related issues with your solution.

Don’t forget to share your solution around. The more people who see your solution, the more likely you are to get feedback from a number of people.

Also, be sure to check out other people’s solutions to see how others have approached the same challenge. There’s a lot to be learned by reading other people’s code. If you have a question about someone’s approach or have some feedback leave a comment on their solution. Frontend Mentor is all about the community helping each other improve, so don’t be afraid to ask questions and help each other out 🙂
